# Gravity_interaction
this project is using pygame as it drawing machine
Simulating Gravity interaction between objects
first i defined math tools i needed like vectors points etc ...
then i defined a function that returns a Gravity vector from one mass to another.
ofc i needed a time class for calculating t and dt.
the trace class gives a good method for analysing and debugging the project.
there is some examples if you want to test the project in Examples folder. 
if you want to contribute let me know.
